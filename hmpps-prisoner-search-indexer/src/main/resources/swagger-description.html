<h3>Service for indexing prisoners for HMPPS Prisoner Search</h3>
<p>Background service for listening to changes to prisoners and then updating OpenSearch with the changes.</p>
<p>A side effect of this is that the service can detect changes to prisoners and raise events.</p>
<p>Events are only generated when this service detects a change in the index record for the prisoner.</p>
<h4>HMPPS domain events - <b>hmpps-domain-events</b> topic</h4>
<div>
  This service publishes significant events to the <b>hmpps-domain-events</b> topic. All events have these common
  fields:
  <ul>
    <li><b>eventType</b> string</li>
    <li><b>occurredAt</b> ISO offset date time - when the event was recorded e.g 2021-02-08T14:41:11.526762Z</li>
    <li><b>version</b> number - version of this event message. Currently <b>1</b></li>
    <li><b>description</b> string - human-readable description of event</li>
    <li><b>detailUrl</b> string - a link to the prisoner in prisoner search</li>

  </ul>
  The different event types are:

      <h4>prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.updated</h4>
      This is when a prisoner index record has been updated. Note

<h3>Topic subscription</h3>
<p>Clients are expected to use a SQS AWS queue to receive events with queue subscribed to <b>hmpps-domain-topic</b>
  to listen to the above events.</p>
<p>Clients can subscribe to one or more events. A typical subscription could be:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "activities_domain_events_subscription" {
  provider  = aws.london
  topic_arn = module.hmpps-domain-events.topic_arn
  protocol  = "sqs"
  endpoint  = module.activities_domain_events_queue.sqs_arn
  filter_policy = jsonencode({
    eventType = [
      "prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.alerts-updated",
      "prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.released",
      "prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.received"
    ]
  })
}
</pre>
<p>and this would be defined in your own namespace.</p>
