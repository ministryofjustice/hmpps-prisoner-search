<h3>Service for indexing prisoners for HMPPS Prisoner Search</h3>
<p>Background service for listening to changes to prisoners and then updating OpenSearch with the changes.</p>
<p>A side effect of this is that the service can detect changes to prisoners and raise events.</p>
<p>Events are only generated when this service detects a change in the index record for the prisoner.</p>
<h4>Please see the link to the event docs in the
  <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-prisoner-search/blob/main/hmpps-prisoner-search-indexer/README.md">repository README</a>
  for information on the HMPPS domain events that are published
</h4>
<h3>Topic subscription</h3>
<p>Clients are expected to use a SQS AWS queue to receive events with queue subscribed to <b>hmpps-domain-topic</b>
  to listen to the above events.</p>
<p>Clients can subscribe to one or more events. A typical subscription could be:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "activities_domain_events_subscription" {
  provider  = aws.london
  topic_arn = module.hmpps-domain-events.topic_arn
  protocol  = "sqs"
  endpoint  = module.activities_domain_events_queue.sqs_arn
  filter_policy = jsonencode({
    eventType = [
      "prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.alerts-updated",
      "prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.released",
      "prisoner-offender-search.prisoner.received"
    ]
  })
}
</pre>
<p>and this would be defined in your own namespace.</p>
